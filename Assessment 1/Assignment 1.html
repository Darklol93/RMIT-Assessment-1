Introduction IT <br>
My Profile: Jake Waterson - s3857894</h1>

<h1>Personal Information</h1>

<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
<p>I have many areas of interest within Information Technology, but the areas that particularly interest me are programming/coding/ scripting and Cyber security. <br> 
    I’m interested in coding because I like the idea of you can create scrips or programs to automize tasks, and how you can use Command Line Interface (CLI) to quickly navigate thorough out an environment and to gather information. <br>
    I have also been interested in Cyber Security and how simple it can be too access information. <br>
    Finally, one of the things that always intrudes me about IT is there is always new things to learn.</p>

<h2>When did your interest in IT Start? Was there a particual event of person that sparked your interest?</h2>
<p>I think Information Technology started to interest me as a young adult, I always thought it was pretty cool watching people tapping away at keyboards. 
    I started getting further interested into it when I was working in the Navy as a Communications and Information Systems sailor. <br>
    I found it relatively easy to pick up, and I started enjoying researching the issue and trying to solve it, before escalating an issue to the Wintel Team. <br>
    I also gained additional interest in when I met someone in the Cyber Security field, thought it was interesting. I was fascinated by the idea of penetration testing and hacking.<br>

<h2>Outline your IT experience (if any). </h2>
<p>Over the past years I have gained a extensive of experience in the IT field. Firstly, as mentioned previously working in the Navy, this was good because it wasn’t just standard IT equipment I worked with. <br>
Additionally, I worked as Desktop Support Technician as a contractor to Defence, Junior Wintel Engineer also as Contractor to Defence. I Currently Systems/Mobility Engineer but also getting with Robotic Process Automation.</p>

<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
<p>I chose to study at RMIT on recommendation from someone how previously studied there.
     As I wanted to study online and RMIT offered this solution through Open Universities Australia I investigated further. </p>

<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
<p>The things I expect to learn from my studies include gaining a basic standard of knowledge. I would also like get good knowledge and skills in the programming subjects. <br>
    Additionally, learn how to manage and lead from Minor in Management. Eventually I would to become a team lead and potentially, one day a Chief Information Officer.</p>

<h1>Project - Developing Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I have identified Artificial Intelligence (AI) as practical approach to assist both humans and other life in their daily lives. We have seen basic AI technology within our daily lives, some examples are:
a.	Google Home
b.	Siri
c.	Bixby
However, the idea and passion behind this project is to develop this technology on a larger more technical scale.
We have soon blockbuster footage of AI running complex algorithms down to opening doors for key personal. An iconic example is the JARVIS AI from the marvel films. To reiterate, I would like to build on existing technology to and develop a new era of AI that has only been in the blockbuster world
</p>



<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>If Artificial Intelligence can be developed to a point where it could analyse data in an instant, or make split second decision, it can a great asset to both humans and animals.  An example of this would be implementing AI in to a ship, where you could give commands to start the engines or change course – make split second decisions if there is a risk of hazards at sea.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The product is a learning system that is able to understand a very broad range of events, understand their context, 
     and recommend a course of action based off previously observed successful outcomes in cases with a high degree of similarity. <br>
     <ol>For example:<br>
<li>Artificial Intelligence designed to be able to learn from many sources of information. This will be from multiple sources, such as processing information from multiple databases, whether that is information on websites or a Medical Systems.  Another source that will be a focus point is humans and animals. We want to be able to teach the AI to recognise human feelings and emotions so it is able to interact with society with a personality. It is also important that we are able to teach it how interact with humans so it eliminates that ‘talking to a machine mentality’</li>
<li>Problem solving will be another core focus of the AI solution. As the solution will be able to quickly process information, we want to be able to teach it how to solve problems or in a matter of speaking thing for its self to take action. A brief example of this could be using Artificial Intelligence to process a Medical Chart and symptoms of a patient and help provide a diagnosis.</li>
<li>As one of the core concepts of Artificial Intelligence is to work with humans, it will need to understand them. It will need to use social intelligence to understand emotions feelings and reactions. Once the system is able to understand this, it could help find ways to communicate with people that have Autism or are socially impaired. The AI system would also use social intelligence for general interaction with humans, potentially giving it emotions and reactions to minimize the machine to human segregation.</p></li>
     </ol>

     <h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
<p>To be able build this Artificial Intelligence Solution, there will be required tools and technologies. It would be assumed that the developers would have access to or own a capable laptop or computer. At minimum the additional tools required would be:
<ol>
<li>A. Git repository – This will allow the developers to simultaneously work on code and keep track of changes. Additionally, as it is saved to the repository you can access this as long as you have access to a workstation and an internet connection. Furthermore, it serves as a backup solution.</li>
<li>B. Red hat OpenShift – This will allow a Scalable environment,we will be able to rapidly develop and deploy , it also is portable allowing to be easily shifted between (for example) Amazon Web Service or Microsoft Azure.</li>
<li>C. Code editor - This is the application that will assist you in writing the code. It will help you select the required format (I.E Python) and it will detect errors and assist in debugging. </p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>To be able build this Artificial Intelligence Solution, there will be required tools and technologies. It would be assumed that the developers would have access to or own a capable laptop or computer. At minimum the additional tools required would be:Teamwork, communication and creativity. Listed above are the recommend minimum skillset to work on this project, however this may be adjusted as necessary. b.	In addition to the listed core and soft skills, having knowledge and understanding of the AI community would be valuable to the project.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If this project was successfully completed and launched to the broader community, we will have provided a capable Artificial Intelligence Solution. As mentioned throughout this plan, it will be able to assist in the daily world of both humans and animals. We will have the technology to assist in the medial community. As well as using this AI technology will be able to be implemented in high risk environments, such as aircraft and ships, there for being able to assist in normal operations or intervene if a risk or danger is detected. </p>
